### Reviewer expectations
When a pull request is put into review state, try to get a reviewer into it as soon as possible.
When a ticket gets reviewed, I would expect:

+ If the pull request is marked as WIP:
Any reviewing should only be done to catch up on the implementation, and not be final.
The code do not have to pass tests in this case.

### For clarifying complex code:
Do more visualizations of code structure (call hierarchies), to understand interconnectivity and also to discover logic that could be improved.

### Security
Always consider security issues.
